About
Paul McCartney is a legendary, multi-platinum singer-songwriter from Liverpool, England. After changing music history throughout the 1960s as a founding member of The Beatles, Paul launched his solo career in 1970 with his debut solo album, McCartney, which he recorded entirely by himself and released just a matter of weeks before The Fab Four’s final studio album, Let It Be. Highlights among his 19 solo albums include Ram (with wife Linda McCartney) (1971), McCartney II (1980), Tug of War (1982), Give My Regards to Broad Street (1984), Chaos and Creation in the Backyard (2005), Kisses on the Bottom (2012) and McCartney III (2020). Paul spent the 1970s topping the charts and packing venues with Wings, earning No. 1 hits like “My Love,” “Band on the Run,” “Silly Love Songs” and “With a Little Luck.” McCartney has also delved into classical music with releases like Paul McCartney’s Liverpool Oratorio (with Carl Davis) (1991) and Paul McCartney’s Ocean’s Kingdom (2011) and launched the experimental act The Fireman in 1993. Over the course of his career, Paul has won 19 Grammy Awards out of 83 nominations. He is credited with the most No. 1 singles of any artist in his native United Kingdom, and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice — once with The Beatles in 1988 and again as a solo artist (including his work with Wings) in 1999. In 2025, McCartney will embark on the latest leg of his acclaimed globe-spanning GOT BACK Tour.

About
THE O'JAYS IN CONCERT:

When it comes to classy, color-coordinated, old-school soul showmanship, nobody can touch the O'Jays. Taking the stage in matching suits to perform beloved classics from their decade-spanning catalog, the debonair trio never fails to transport audiences back to the good old days of "Love Train" and "For the Love of Money." Hot off the heels of their 2013 induction into the R&B Music Hall of Fame, the O'Jays will treat fans to several highly anticipated appearances in 2014.

BACKGROUND SNAPSHOT:

Formed in Ohio in 1958, The O'Jays experienced moderate success throughout the '60s with a string of minor hits like "Lonely Drifter" and  "Lipstick Traces." On the verge of calling it quits in the early '70s, the band finally got their big break after signing to Philadelphia International for their platinum-selling 1972 single "Back Stabbers." The song established them as a key player in the Philadelphia soul movement, a funk-infused brand of soul that pioneered many of the elements later adopted by disco. A string of hits would follow throughout the '70s, including epochal No. 1 smash "Love Train," creating a legacy the band continues to honor today with their spirited performances on tour.

FANS WHO BOUGHT TICKETS SAY:

"They sounded great and put on a really great show. They sang all of their popular songs, ending with For the Love of Money...which brought the house down. Everyone was on their feet, dancing and singing and really enjoying the show."

"This was a great show. They performed their old-school moves and wore matching outfits, something you don't see with ‘newer’ performers."

"The show was awesome. The O'Jays took me down memory lane and back. The show was attended by ages 20-80 and all had a great time."

About
Lady A Concert Schedule

Lady A (formerly known as "Lady Antebellum") became one of the 21st century's most successful trios thanks to a radio-friendly, harmony-laden sound that effortlessly straddles contemporary country and mainstream pop. The Nashville outfit first hit the road supporting the likes of Martina McBride, Jason Aldean, and Kenny Chesney before embarking on their first headline trek, Need You Now, in 2010. They have continued to wow audiences across the globe ever since, including on world tours such as 2014's Take the Night, 2015's Wheels Up and 2017's You Look Good, where they played famed venues such as the Old National Centre in Indianapolis or Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado. Packed with flawless vocals, rich three-part harmonies, and a mixture of No. 1 hits and fan favorites, as well as the odd surprise cover, the Lady Alive show is a visually appealing, toe-tapping, feel-good experience from start to finish.

Lady A Background

Lead vocalists Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott and multi-instrumentalist Dave Heywood first came together in Nashville, Tennessee in 2006. Named after the architectural style that originated in the 19th-century Deep South, Lady A (formerly known as "Lady Antebellum") began performing on their local circuit before landing a deal with Capitol Records Nashville in 2007. They first came to national attention later that year with U.S. Country Top 3 single "Love Don't Live Here." Their eponymous debut LP arrived in 2008, kickstarting a run of four consecutive chart-toppers on the U.S. Country Album chart, spawning the first of many No. 1 hits, the Grammy-winning "I Run To You," and landing them Vocal Group of the Year at the ACMs. 2009 sophomore Need You Now took the band's career to another level, reaching the top of the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of nearly half-a-million and producing a No. 2 hit on the U.S. Hot 100 with its title track. Lady A continued to dominate the country-pop scene throughout the following decade, topping the Billboard 200 once more with 2011's Own the Night and 2013's Golden, winning Favorite Country Band, Duo or Group at the American Music Awards three years straight and scoring multiple No. 1 hits, including "American Honey," "Our Kind of Love" and "Just a Kiss." Following 2014's 747, the trio took a hiatus to focus on their respective solo careers. But they picked up where they left off in 2017 with their chart-topping sixth studio effort, Heart Break.

About
Legendary New York-bred singer-songwriter Billy Joel has toured only sporadically in recent years, but fans have plenty of opportunities to score tickets to see him in concert going forward -- if they're willing to head out to New York's Madison Square Garden. Joel signed an open-ended deal with MSG that will have him playing a concert at the venue once per month for as long as there's demand. And demand has never been a problem for Joel at he historic New York venue; he played his first show there in 1978, and had logged 46 concerts at the arena by 2013. 
New York isn't alone in its love for the singer. Joel has long been established as one of the top-grossing touring artists in the U.S., and has sold more than 150 million records over the course his four-decade career. After recording a long string of hits including "Piano Man," "New York State of Mind," "Just the Way You Are," "You May Be Right," "Pressure," "Uptown Girl," "We Didn't Start the Fire," and  "The River of Dreams," Joel decided that he was done writing pop and rock songs. It's a decision he's stuck with; it's been more than 20 years since he's recorded a new pop or rock album. He's composed new classical material instead, while continuing to play songs from his catalog in concert.

About
Childish Gambino is the stage name of Donald Glover, a rapper, actor, writer, producer and multi-hyphenate from Stone Mountain, Georgia. The DeKalb County native self-released a number of mixtapes from 2008 to 2010 before starring in the NBC comedy Community for five seasons. While appearing as Troy Barnes in the cult comedy series, the rapper dropped his debut album, Camp, in 2011. He followed that LP in 2013 with his sophomore effort Because the Internet and earned his first Grammy nominations for Album of the Year and Record of the Year for his 2013 studio set Awaken, My Love! and its single “Redbone,” respectively. In 2018, Glover unveiled his politically charged single “This Is America.” The track went viral thanks to its cinematic music video, hitting No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and winning the artist four Grammys including Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Music Video and Best Rap/Sung Performance. In 2020, Glover surprise-released his fourth album 3.15.20 on his website, where it played on loop for just 12 hours. It was officially released a week later. He plans to drop two albums (his final two as Childish Gambino) — Atavista and Bando Stone & the New World — throughout 2024 ahead of The New World Tour.

About
As he began work on his sophomore album, the artist known as keshi found himself at a remarkable crossroads: the end of 2 years straight of sold-out touring, the achievement of hitting nearly 11 billion global streams, and the prospect of turning 30 on the oh-so-near horizon. Born Casey Luong and raised in Sugarland, Texas, keshi has built a massive career almost entirely on the strength of his innate ability to render emotional vulnerability through song. Since 2017, he's released a trilogy of EPs and a breakthrough debut album GABRIEL -- which crossed 3.1 billion streams alone -- weaving the rhythms and melodies of pop, R&B, lo-fi, and hip hop into barefaced confessions about love, loneliness, and loss. And finally, after a whirlwind of singing those very personal songs to screaming audiences all over the world, he landed back in Texas, in need of something different: time and space, the freedom to work on music unbothered by the hectic chaos of live shows and promotion, and a home studio in which he could create a sophomore album that encompassed all he had learned and lived.

Requiem is the culmination of a career on the brink -- of blockbuster success, arena-sized shows, and a powerful personal evolution, the moment when a rookie artist steps into his place as a fully formed adult one. He was once a kid from Texas wavering about quitting his job as a nurse to pursue his dreams as a musician, causing anxiety in his more traditional Vietnamese family who hoped he'd stay in medicine; now, he is a major label artist who has sold out Radio City (twice!), with a ravenous fan base who has stuck with him since his Soundcloud days. GABRIEL led to two, back-to-back headlining North American tours, one world tour, and one tour in China. It reached #4 on Billboard, which became the highest charting debut album from a new artist in 2022. And the singles, including "LIMBO," "UNDERSTAND," and "GET IT," became viral sensations. All of a sudden there were stakes to the game -- his life was serious business, his art listened to by millions of people. "I'm just hitting a turn in my life when it's not always just fun and games -- and I wanted to have a weight on the record in that sort of way," he says. "At a certain point in an artist's lifespan, there's room for evolution and growth. It doesn't mean that you leave everything behind. But it means that you take risks."

And risks he took on Requiem. "It's about going back to what makes you love music in the first place," he says. "To hit it in a really pure way." The 13-song album is a spirited ride through genre, from classic Y2K-style pop ("Night") to homesick country ("Texas") to meditations on mortality and meaning ("Just to Die"). "I strove to create a varied and cohesive record that's timeless," he says. "I wanted Requiem to feel grand, bold and dynamic, for it to be someone else's classic record that they'd come back to again and again.

To create something so personal, he assembled his friends and frequent collaborators at a private studio in his home in Texas, far away from the loud revving industry engines in New York and Los Angeles. He played bass, guitar, piano, and even viola for various recordings. Instead of the pressure of concentrated writing sessions, he let melodies and ideas come to him while ambling about his life, playing video games, reading, whatever. "I lounge around and wait until something manifests inside of me. Until I have something I want to say," he says. "That's kind of how I get my best work." This space allowed him to contemplate the big things in his life, like the dissolution of a romantic relationship that left him bereft and led to the song "War," with biting, but terribly relatable lyrics -- Since you wanna go to war / Let's see who hurts the other more -- sung with verve in his signature falsetto.

He wasn't afraid of existential inquiry, either. This crossroads he found himself at brought up big questions about who he is, where he's going, and why he's here. He thought a lot about a good friend and collaborator who passed away, wishing, on the eponymous "Requiem," that that person could still be here on this wild ride with him. He explored the nature of fame and what it means to have purpose on songs like "Amen." He opined about regret and romance on "Dream." And he eulogized his own childhood on the sweetly nostalgic "Texas," singing to his 17-year-old self about the various roads not taken and that special moment in time when he still, as he sings, had a lifetime waiting right in front of me.

Lest it all seems serious, it's important to say that he's having fun, too! On the expertly realized "Night," you can practically see the boy band choreography in your head. No matter the vibe and virtue of a particular song on Requiem, all of them sound bigger and bolder than anything he's done before. The poppy and peppy first single "Say" feels tailor-made to become an anthem, sung along to by crowds of thousands at massive live shows. That's what's needed at a crossroads like this, after all: just since 2019, keshi has gone from selling out small 250-capacity clubs to headlining his own upcoming global arena tour in 2024-2025, including stops at Madison Square Garden in NYC and the Forum in LA. This is to say, at a junction this dramatic, keshi might not be exactly sure what the future holds, or where his life and career will go next on this rollercoaster of an existence he's had. But the point is, it almost doesn't matter: with Requiem, he's shown that whatever comes his way, there will be beautiful music made to accompany it.

About
New Kids on the Block are a multi-platinum-selling boy band formed in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Featuring Jonathan Knight, Jordan Knight, Donnie Wahlberg, Joey McIntyre and Danny Wood, NKOTB became a singing, dancing fivesome in 1984 and hit the top of the Billboard 200 a few years later with the release of their 1988 sophomore album Hangin’ Tough, which spawned hit singles “You Got It (The Right Stuff),” “I’ll Be Loving You (Forever),” “Hangin’ Tough” and “Cover Girl.” At the dawn of the ‘90s, NKOTB scored a second No. 1 album with 1990’s Step By Step and the following year became the first music group in history to headline a Super Bowl halftime show. Their success paved the way for future generations of teen pop sensations like Take That, *NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, One Direction and others. After initially disbanding in 1994, the quintet reunited in 2008 and have since released two more albums: 2008’s The Block and 2013’s 10, as well as an updated re-release of their 1999 greatest hits compilation.

Official Ticket Marketplace of the Portland Trail Blazers

Portland Trail Blazers History

The Trail Blazers joined the NBA in the 1970 expansion. Despite the presence of back-to-back rookies of the year Geoff Petrie and Sidney Wicks, they struggled, finishing last in their division five of their first six seasons. Then, in a remarkable reversal, they went 49-33 in the 1976–77 season, led by big men Bill Walton and Maurice Lucas, guards Lionel Hollins and Dave Twardzik, and head coach Jack Ramsay.

After defeating the Chicago Bulls, Denver Nuggets and Los Angeles Lakers in the first three rounds of the playoffs, they found themselves pitted against a powerhouse Philadelphia 76ers team led by Julius Erving, Caldwell Jones and George McGinnis in the NBA Finals. They dropped the first two games of the series but stormed back to win four straight to capture the franchise's only championship.

Title in hand, the Blazers would go on to make the playoffs 25 of the next 26 seasons. For 12 seasons starting in 1983, the catalyst was guard Clyde Drexler. In the 1989–90 season, with All-Star forward Buck Williams joining the team, the Blazers again made the NBA Finals, falling in five games to the Detroit Pistons. They posted a franchise-best 63-19 record the next season but succumbed to the Lakers in the Conference Finals. Another trip to the NBA Finals awaited in 1991–92, but the Blazers lost in six games to a Chicago Bulls team led by Michael Jordan.

The Blazers' forays into the playoffs continued through the 2002–03 season, with two of those trips, in 1998–99 and 1999–00, ending in losses in the conference finals. Beginning in the latter half of the 2000s, the team reached sustained regular season success behind notable talents like Brandon Roy, LaMarcus Aldridge, Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Roy and Lillard both received the Rookie of the Year award for their respective first seasons.

About
Official Ticket Marketplace of the Sacramento Kings

Sacramento Kings History

The Sacramento Kings' lineage traces to Rochester, New York, where they played under four names, including the Royals, for 12 years (1945–57). Led by Hall of Famers Bob Davies, Bobby Wanzer and Arnie Risen, the team defeated the New York Knicks to win the NBA championship in 1951, the highlight of a seven-year run in the playoffs.

The Royals moved to Cincinnati for the 1957–58 season and added local college standout Oscar Robertson in 1960. Led by the "Big O," they advanced to the division finals in the 1962–63 and 1963–64 seasons, with the second year featuring contributions from Rookie of the Year Jerry Lucas.

After a five-year run of futility in the late 1960s and early '70s, the team relocated to Kansas City, adopting the name the Kings because the city's MLB team was named the Royals. For three years, the franchise divided its home games between Kansas City and Omaha, Nebraska, and were known as the Kansas City-Omaha Kings. Led by Coach of the Year Phil Johnson, they made the playoffs in 1974–75. In the 10 seasons that followed as the Kansas City Kings, the team made the playoffs four times, most memorably in 1980–81 behind guard Otis Birdsong.

The franchise relocated to Sacramento in 1985, but failed to post a winning record until the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, when a team led by Chris Webber, Vlade Divac, Vernon Maxwell, Scot Pollard, and Jon Barry went 27-23. It was the first of eight consecutive seasons in the playoffs, highlighted by a trip to the 2002 Conference Finals.

In 2023, under new coach Mike Brown and All-Stars Domantas Sabonis and De’Aaron Fox, the Kings advanced to the playoffs, ultimately losing in the first round to reigning NBA champions the Golden State Warriors in a close seven-game series. Brown was named the 2022–23 season’s Coach of the Year, while Fox collected the league’s first Clutch Player of the Year Award.

About
Last-minute tickets to see Leslie Odom Jr. in HAMILTON will be released on a rolling basis through November 26. For updated availability, check Ticketmaster regularly.

Now in its 10th year on Broadway, HAMILTON at New York’s Richard Rodgers Theatre, with its innovative mix of history and hip-hop, has remained “The Room Where It Happens.” The groundbreaking Lin-Manuel Miranda production, based on Ron Chernow’s 2004 biography of founding father Alexander Hamilton, has gripped theatergoers since its 2015 debut. Immediately hailed as another milestone achievement by Miranda, who previously won a Tony Award and a Grammy for his first musical, In The Heights, HAMILTON became the most-nominated production in Tony Awards’ history and won 11 of its 16 contests, the second-largest haul in the ceremony's history. Among many other accolades, the musical earned a Pulitzer Prize in Drama, two Emmys for the stage film released on Disney+ in 2020, and a Grammy for the 2015 original Broadway cast recording, which peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart and became the first Broadway cast album to reach Diamond certification by the RIAA in 2023. While it certainly made Lin-Manuel Miranda as much of a household name as the man behind his titular role, HAMILTON also launched the careers of his castmates, including Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr, Phillipa Soo as Eliza Hamilton, Renée Elise Goldsberry as Angelica Schuyler, Daveed Diggs as Marquis de Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson and Anthony Ramos as John Laurens/Philip Hamilton.
